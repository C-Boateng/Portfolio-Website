      information: `### Overview
My Bachelor’s thesis, titled "A Multimodal Approach to Automating Product Listings with Machine Learning", develops a framework to automate clothing listings on e-commerce platforms like eBay and Vinted. The project addresses inefficiencies in manual listing creation by integrating computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and a custom dataset.
### Objectives
The main research question is: *How can a multimodal machine learning framework automate clothing listings for online marketplaces?* Sub-questions include:
- How can computer vision ensure precise color extraction from clothing images?
- How can a BERT model be optimized for platform-specific category classification?
- How effective are large language models (LLMs) in generating platform-specific titles and descriptions?

### Methodology
- **Color Extraction**: Used SAM2 for segmentation and K-means clustering to extract dominant colors, evaluated on Kaggle datasets (e.g., 0.2738 eBay F1-score).
- **Category Classification**: Fine-tuned BERT-base-uncased for multi-task classification, achieving 0.9964 accuracy for eBay and 0.9738 for Vinted on a synthetic dataset of 8,400 samples.
- **Text Generation**: Evaluated four Ollama LLMs (TinyLlama, Smollm2, Mistral, Phi-4) for platform-specific titles and descriptions, using ROUGE and BLEU metrics.
- **Dataset**: Created a custom dataset via automated scraping and manual validation to address the lack of standardized training data.
- **UI**: Developed a PyQt5-based desktop application with a multi-page interface for image uploads, processing, and review of generated listings.

### Key Contributions
- **End-to-End Framework**: Integrates SAM2, BERT, and TinyLlama for a cohesive listing automation pipeline.
- **Custom Datasets**: Two synthetic datasets for training and evaluation, addressing gaps in e-commerce data.
- **Reproducible Notebooks**: Three Jupyter notebooks (CV_Evaluation.ipynb, Bert_Fine_Tuning.ipynb, LLM_Evaluation.ipynb) for reproducibility and learning.
- **Scalable Tool**: A user-friendly application that reduces manual effort and enhances listing consistency.

### Outcomes
The framework achieved significant time savings while maintaining high accuracy. It offers a scalable solution for e-commerce automation, with potential for API integration.
